###### synergize the power of both julia and python
`OlivePy` provides the [Olive](https://github.com/ChifiSource/Olive.jl) editor with the ability to read `.py` files, evaluate Python, and even combine evaluation between Python and Julia together. To add `OlivePy`, 
simply use `using` in your `olive.jl` home file. For more information, check out [adding extensions](https://github.com/ChifiSource/Olive.jl#adding-extensions)
```julia
using OlivePy
```
